  <hi>Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats</hi>  
<h2>Pets provide their owners, or guardians,[1] both physical and emotional benefits.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>People most commonly get pets for companionship, to protect a home or property, or because of the perceived beauty or attractiveness of the animals.</h3>
<p><i>A pet, or <strong>companion animal</strong></i>, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.</p>
